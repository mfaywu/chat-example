# chat-example
This repo is for me to practice using Socket.IO and my first experience with JavaScript.
I followed the Socket.IO chat example http://socket.io/get-started/chat/ and am currently 
implementing the list of ideas at the bottom of the webpage to practice and have some fun. 

## Features
